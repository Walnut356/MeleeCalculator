# StunLagCalculator

Very simple calculation for hitlag and shieldstun using a float point damage input. I have NO handling for erroneous inputs (letters, gigantic numbers, etc.) because this is the first thing i've ever made. So, y'know, intentionally trying to break this will work. Very easily. 

Mainly just a very quick reference so I don't have to open google docs every 5 seconds to calculate this stuff.

Future plans involve: 

looping so you don't have to re-open every time you want to test a new number

moving from a console application to something with a GUI (lol)

calculating hitstun/knockback (requires character sheets i think?)

Stale move modifier (maybe? usually not that important, semi-handled by "how much damage does it do?")

More conditions/outputs (CC, charging smash attack, frame advantage, powershielded frame advantage, etc.)

Handling for errors
